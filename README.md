This project is part of my AICTE Edunet Shell Internship, where the goal is to develop an intelligent chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). During Week 2 of the internship, I focused on the implementation of logistic regression, vectorization, and tokenization to enhance the chatbot’s ability to process and understand user inputs. I implemented Logistic Regression for binary classification, enabling the chatbot to classify user queries into predefined categories for appropriate responses. To process the text data, I utilized CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, which helped transform raw text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. Additionally, I worked with Tokenization techniques to break down sentences into smaller tokens, which allowed the chatbot to better interpret the structure of user queries. Through these steps, I was able to optimize the chatbot’s ability to understand varied inputs and generate more accurate responses. Throughout the week, I also made significant code improvements, including refining the tokenization process, optimizing the vectorization for better feature extraction, and adjusting the logistic regression model’s parameters to increase accuracy. This work has strengthened my understanding of NLP techniques and their application in building more intelligent, responsive systems like chatbots.
